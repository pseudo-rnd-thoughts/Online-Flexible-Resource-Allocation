    abstract = "We introduce a variant of the knapsack problem, in which the weights of items are also variables but must satisfy a system of linear constraints, and the capacity of knapsack is given and known. We discuss two models: (1) the value of each item is given; (2) the value-to-weight ratio of each item is given. The goal is to determine the weight of each item, and to find a subset of items such that the total weight is no more than the capacity and the total value is maximized. We provide several practical application scenarios that motivate our study, and then investigate the computational complexity and corresponding algorithms. In particular, we show that if the number of constraints is a fixed constant, then both problems can be solved in polynomial time. If the number of constraints is an input, then we show that the first problem is NP-Hard and cannot be approximated within any constant factor unless {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}P{\}}= {\backslash}mathrm{\{}NP{\}}{\$}{\$}P=NP, while the second problem is NP-Hard but admits a polynomial time approximation scheme. We further propose approximation algorithms for both problems, and extend the results to multiple knapsack cases with a fixed number of knapsacks and identical capacities.",

    abstract = "The cloud system is designed, implemented and conceptualized as a marketplace where resources are traded. This demands efficient allocation of resources to benefit both the cloud users and the cloud service providers. Accordingly, market based resource allocation models for cloud computing have been proposed. These models apply economy based approaches e.g. auction, negotiation etc. This work makes a detailed study of the double auction mechanisms and their applicability for the cloud markets. A framework for a future cloud market using double auction is also proposed. As most of the existing works in double auction confines only resource allocation, therefore, a Truthful Multi-Unit Double Auction mechanism (TMDA) is proposed that would help researchers to understand how a truthful double auction mechanism can be designed. TMDA is proven to be asymptotically efficient, individual rational, truthful and budget-balanced. TMDA would also encourage researchers to contribute in this emerging area. The performance of TMDA, which addresses the interests of both the cloud user and the provider, has been validated through simulation study. Various challenges in the realization of double auction mechanisms in cloud computing along-with the future possibilities are also presented."

Here, efficient resource allocation mechanisms are needed to assign limited fog resources to competing IoT tasks. To this end, we consider two challenges: (1) near-optimal resource allocation in a fog computing system; (2) incentivising self-interested fog users to report their tasks truthfully. To address these challenges, we develop a truthful online resource allocation mechanism called flexible online greedy. The key idea is that the mechanism only commits a certain amount of computational resources to a task when it arrives. However, when and where to allocate resources stays flexible until the completion of the task. We compare our mechanism to four benchmarks and show that it outperforms all of them in terms of social welfare by up to 10\% and achieves a social welfare of about 90\% of the offline optimal upper bound.},

Considered is a conglomerate-type organization consisting of a set of semi-autonomous subunits that are coordinated by the organization's head. The head's incentive problem is to choose a set of employee compensation rules that will induce his subunit managers to communicate accurate information and take optimal decisions. The main result exhibits a particular set of compensation rules, an optimal incentive structure, that leads to team behavior. Particular attention is directed to the informational aspects of the problem. An extended example of a resource allocation model is discussed and the optimal incentive structure is interpreted in terms of prices charged by the head for resources allocated to the subunits.},

    abstract = "Big data applications are consuming most of the space in industry and research area. Among the widespread examples of big data, the role of video streams from CCTV cameras is equally important as other sources like social media data, sensor data, agriculture data, medical data and data evolved from space research. Surveillance videos have a major contribution in unstructured big data. CCTV cameras are implemented in all places where security having much importance. Manual surveillance seems tedious and time consuming. Security can be defined in different terms in different contexts like theft identification, violence detection, chances of explosion etc. In crowded public places the term security covers almost all type of abnormal events. Among them violence detection is difficult to handle since it involves group activity. The anomalous or abnormal activity analysis in a crowd video scene is very difficult due to several real world constraints. The paper includes a deep rooted survey which starts from object recognition, action recognition, crowd analysis and finally violence detection in a crowd environment. Majority of the papers reviewed in this survey are based on deep learning technique. Various deep learning methods are compared in terms of their algorithms and models. The main focus of this survey is application of deep learning techniques in detecting the exact count, involved persons and the happened activity in a large crowd at all climate conditions. Paper discusses the underlying deep learning implementation technology involved in various crowd video analysis methods. Real time processing, an important issue which is yet to be explored more in this field is also considered. Not many methods are there in handling all these issues simultaneously. The issues recognized in existing methods are identified and summarized. Also future direction is given to reduce the obstacles identified. The survey provides a bibliographic summary of papers from ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore and ACM digital library.",

    abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms. }
