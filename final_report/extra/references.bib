We discuss two models: (1) the value of each item is given; (2) the value-to-weight ratio of each item is given. The goal is to determine the weight of each item, and to find a subset of items such that the total weight is no more than the capacity and the total value is maximized. We provide several practical application scenarios that motivate our study, and then investigate the computational complexity and corresponding algorithms. In particular, we show that if the number of constraints is a fixed constant, then both problems can be solved in polynomial time. If the number of constraints is an input, then we show that the first problem is NP-Hard and cannot be approximated within any constant factor unless {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}P{\}}= {\backslash}mathrm{\{}NP{\}}{\$}{\$}P=NP, while the second problem is NP-Hard but admits a polynomial time approximation scheme. We further propose approximation algorithms for both problems, and extend the results to multiple knapsack cases with a fixed number of knapsacks and identical capacities.",

    abstract = "The cloud system is designed, implemented and conceptualized as a marketplace where resources are traded. This demands efficient allocation of resources to benefit both the cloud users and the cloud service providers. Accordingly, market based resource allocation models for cloud computing have been proposed. These models apply economy based approaches e.g. auction, negotiation etc. This work makes a detailed study of the double auction mechanisms and their applicability for the cloud markets. A framework for a future cloud market using double auction is also proposed. As most of the existing works in double auction confines only resource allocation, therefore, a Truthful Multi-Unit Double Auction mechanism (TMDA) is proposed that would help researchers to understand how a truthful double auction mechanism can be designed. TMDA is proven to be asymptotically efficient, individual rational, truthful and budget-balanced. TMDA would also encourage researchers to contribute in this emerging area. The performance of TMDA, which addresses the interests of both the cloud user and the provider, has been validated through simulation study. Various challenges in the realization of double auction mechanisms in cloud computing along-with the future possibilities are also presented."

Here, efficient resource allocation mechanisms are needed to assign limited fog resources to competing IoT tasks. To this end, we consider two challenges: (1) near-optimal resource allocation in a fog computing system; (2) incentivising self-interested fog users to report their tasks truthfully. To address these challenges, we develop a truthful online resource allocation mechanism called flexible online greedy. The key idea is that the mechanism only commits a certain amount of computational resources to a task when it arrives. However, when and where to allocate resources stays flexible until the completion of the task. We compare our mechanism to four benchmarks and show that it outperforms all of them in terms of social welfare by up to 10\% and achieves a social welfare of about 90\% of the offline optimal upper bound.},

Considered is a conglomerate-type organization consisting of a set of semi-autonomous subunits that are coordinated by the organization's head. The head's incentive problem is to choose a set of employee compensation rules that will induce his subunit managers to communicate accurate information and take optimal decisions. The main result exhibits a particular set of compensation rules, an optimal incentive structure, that leads to team behavior. Particular attention is directed to the informational aspects of the problem. An extended example of a resource allocation model is discussed and the optimal incentive structure is interpreted in terms of prices charged by the head for resources allocated to the subunits.},

Dealing with these forces trade-offs between desirable auction properties such as allocative efficiency, revenue maximization, low transaction costs, fairness, failure freeness, and scalability. Computational complexity can be dealt with algorithmically by relegating the computational burden to bidders, by maintaining fairness in the face of computational limitations, by limiting biddable combinations, and by limiting the use of combinatorial bids. Combinatorial auction designs include single-round, first-price sealed bidding, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms, uniform and market-clearing price auctions, and iterative combinatorial auctions. Combinatorial auction designs must deal with exposure problems, threshold problems, ways to keep the bidding moving at a reasonable pace, avoiding and resolving ties, and controlling complexity.},

Among the widespread examples of big data, the role of video streams from CCTV cameras is equally important as other sources like social media data, sensor data, agriculture data, medical data and data evolved from space research. Surveillance videos have a major contribution in unstructured big data. CCTV cameras are implemented in all places where security having much importance. Manual surveillance seems tedious and time consuming. Security can be defined in different terms in different contexts like theft identification, violence detection, chances of explosion etc. In crowded public places the term security covers almost all type of abnormal events. Among them violence detection is difficult to handle since it involves group activity. The anomalous or abnormal activity analysis in a crowd video scene is very difficult due to several real world constraints. The paper includes a deep rooted survey which starts from object recognition, action recognition, crowd analysis and finally violence detection in a crowd environment. Majority of the papers reviewed in this survey are based on deep learning technique. Various deep learning methods are compared in terms of their algorithms and models. The main focus of this survey is application of deep learning techniques in detecting the exact count, involved persons and the happened activity in a large crowd at all climate conditions. Paper discusses the underlying deep learning implementation technology involved in various crowd video analysis methods. Real time processing, an important issue which is yet to be explored more in this field is also considered. Not many methods are there in handling all these issues simultaneously. The issues recognized in existing methods are identified and summarized. Also future direction is given to reduce the obstacles identified. The survey provides a bibliographic summary of papers from ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore and ACM digital library.",

The deterministic policy gradient has a particularly appealing form: it is the expected gradient of the action-value function. This simple form means that the deterministic policy gradient can be estimated much more efficiently than the usual stochastic policy gradient. To ensure adequate exploration, we introduce an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that learns a deterministic target policy from an exploratory behaviour policy. Deterministic policy gradient algorithms outperformed their stochastic counterparts in several benchmark problems, particularly in high-dimensional action spaces.}

It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.",

    abstract = {Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves: the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands: indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent, while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction.},

    abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms. }

@article{DNC,
  abstract = {Artificial neural networks are remarkably adept at sensory processing, sequence learning and reinforcement learning, but are limited in their ability to represent variables and data structures and to store data over long timescales, owing to the lack of an external memory. Here we introduce a machine learning model called a differentiable neural computer (DNC), which consists of a neural network that can read from and write to an external memory matrix, analogous to the random-access memory in a conventional computer. Like a conventional computer, it can use its memory to represent and manipulate complex data structures, but, like a neural network, it can learn to do so from data. When trained with supervised learning, we demonstrate that a DNC can successfully answer synthetic questions designed to emulate reasoning and inference problems in natural language. We show that it can learn tasks such as finding the shortest path between specified points and inferring the missing links in randomly generated graphs, and then generalize these tasks to specific graphs such as transport networks and family trees. When trained with reinforcement learning, a DNC can complete a moving blocks puzzle in which changing goals are specified by sequences of symbols. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DNCs have the capacity to solve complex, structured tasks that are inaccessible to neural networks without external read–write memory.},
