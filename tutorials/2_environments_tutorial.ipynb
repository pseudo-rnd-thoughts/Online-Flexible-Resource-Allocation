    "The goal of Reinforcement Learning (RL) is to design agents that learn by interacting with an environment. In the standard RL setting, the agent receives an observation at every time step and chooses an action. The action is applied to the environment and the environment returns a reward and a new observation. The agent trains a policy to choose actions to maximize the sum of rewards, also known as return.\n",
